This site lists segregated items per user login. Depending upon the user id the items are displayed. 

The users are  validated using the username and password that are stored in the SQL Server database. 

I've used Entity framework and database first approach while creating Entity Model of the Database.

In this I've used mainly created a login page followed by the user logon page with the item images displayed and 
also log off button has been provided.

Environment: ASP .Net MVC, Entity Framework, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, SQL Server.
